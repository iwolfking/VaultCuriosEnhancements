# VaultCuriosEnhancements
Makes vault curios shift-clickable and adds vault compass curio and makes the junk identifier usable in any curio <br>
Mostly server-side mod<br>
It will work if it's installed just on the server, but clients won't see proper curio slot names and shift-clicking curio when curio slot is full might show ghost item in your inventory<br>
